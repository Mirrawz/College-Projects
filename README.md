Here are the Projects I have worked on for college.

The bill.sh is a linux script that prompts the user for a total to their hydro bill and calculates based on a split of each $50. The first at x1, the second at x2, the third at x3 and the 4th at x4.

The equal.sh script is a linux script that prompts the user for 2 lines and determines if they are of equal value or not. My simplest script, but it was a skills based assessment for my term 1 Linux class.

The Max.sh script prompts the user for 5 different numbers and tells you what the highest number is.

The Path.sh script prompts the user for a file path and checks if it is valid. Furthermore, it determines if the path leads to a directory or a file.

box.sh is a script that creates a "Linux Box" which gives you options to check the operating system, locate file paths or see the current working directory based on the case command and requires specific letters as inputs.

case.sh is a pre-linux box script. It was testing for using the case command.

counter.sh is a script that prompts the user for a number and it will automatically count to that given number.

table.sh is a script that prompts the user for a number and a second prompt for the amount the times table should increase by. It creates the multiplication table up to the second number.

login.sh is a script that prompts the user for a username and password. If correct or incorrect, it will give a proper response.
