Here is the Projects I have worked on for college.

The bill.sh is a linux script that prompts the user for a total to their hydro bill and calculates based on a split of each $50. The first at x1, the second at x2, the third at x3 and the 4th at x4.

The equal.sh script is a linux script that prompts the user for 2 lines and determines if they are of equal value or not. My simplest script, but it was a skills based assessment for my term 1 Linux class.
